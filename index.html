              <h2>Key Considerations When Installing Closed Cell Spray Foam</h2>
              <br>
              <p>Installing closed cell spray foam insulation can be a complex process that requires careful consideration and planning. One of the most important considerations is the climate in which the insulation will be installed. The insulation’s R-value, or thermal resistance, is affected by temperature and humidity levels. <br>
              <br>It is essential to choose the appropriate type and thickness of closed cell spray foam insulation to ensure optimal energy efficiency in the specific climate conditions of the installation site. Another consideration when installing closed cell spray foam insulation is the type of substrate or surface on which the insulation will be applied. The substrate must be clean, dry, and free of debris or contaminants. <br>
             <br>It is important to ensure that the substrate is prepared correctly to ensure proper adhesion and reduce the risk of any issues, such as cracking or peeling of the insulation. It is also important to properly prepare the work area, including proper ventilation and protection of surrounding surfaces, to prevent overspray and minimize the risk of fire hazards</p>
